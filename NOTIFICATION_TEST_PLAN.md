- Creator: "You created a new user: [name] ([email])"
- Admins: "New user created: [name] by [creator]"
- New user: "Welcome to Haul Connect! Your account has been created"

#### 3.2 User Updates
**Test Steps:**
1. Update user email
2. Update user role
3. Update user name
4. Change user password

**Expected Results:**

- Admins receive notification of user updates
- Affected user receives notification if updated by someone else

#### 3.3 User Status Changes
**Test Steps:**
1. Activate a deactivated user
2. Deactivate an active user

**Expected Results:**
- Status changer receives confirmation
- Admins receive notification
- Affected user receives appropriate notification

#### 3.4 User Deletion
**Test Steps:**
1. Delete a user account
2. Verify deletion notifications

**Expected Results:**

## Performance Testing

### 5. Bulk Operations Testing

#### 5.1 Multiple Dispatch Creation
**Test Steps:**
1. Create 10+ dispatches in quick succession
2. Monitor notification creation performance
3. Verify all notifications are created correctly

#### 5.2 Mass User Updates
**Test Steps:**
1. Update multiple users simultaneously
2. Verify notification system handles concurrent operations

#### 5.3 High Volume Invoice Processing

1. Create and process multiple invoices
2. Monitor system performance and notification delivery

## Error Handling Testing

### 6. Failure Scenarios

#### 6.1 Email Service Failure
**Test Steps:**
1. Simulate email service failure
2. Verify operations continue without failing
3. Check that internal notifications still work

#### 6.2 Database Connection Issues
**Test Steps:**
1. Simulate temporary database connectivity issues
2. Verify notification creation doesn't break main operations

#### 6.3 Invalid User References
**Test Steps:**
1. Try to send notifications to non-existent users
2. Verify error handling is graceful

## Integration Testing

### 7. End-to-End Workflows

#### 7.1 Complete Dispatch Lifecycle
**Test Steps:**
1. Create dispatch → Update status → Send invoice → Mark as paid → Complete
2. Verify all notifications are sent at each step

#### 7.2 User Onboarding Flow
**Test Steps:**
1. Create user → Assign role → Activate → First login
2. Verify welcome notifications and role assignments

## Reporting and Validation

### 8. Notification Audit

#### 8.1 Notification Log Review
- Verify all notifications are properly logged
- Check notification timestamps and recipients
- Validate notification content accuracy

#### 8.2 User Experience Validation
- Test notification visibility in UI
- Verify notification links work correctly
- Check notification categorization (success, info, warning, error)

## Test Data Requirements

### Sample Test Data
- 5 test users with different roles
- 3 test carriers with valid email addresses
- 10 test dispatches in various statuses
- 5 test invoices in different states

## Success Criteria

### All notifications must:
1. Be created without errors
2. Contain accurate and relevant information
3. Be sent to appropriate recipients
4. Not block or delay main application operations
5. Provide meaningful navigation links
6. Follow consistent messaging patterns

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation Notes:
1. Email notifications require SMTP configuration
2. Bulk operations may experience slight delays
3. External carrier notifications depend on valid email addresses
4. Notification cleanup/archiving not yet implemented

## Recommended Optimizations

### Future Improvements:
1. Implement notification batching for bulk operations
2. Add notification preferences per user
3. Implement real-time notification delivery via WebSocket
4. Add notification templates for better consistency
5. Implement notification archiving/cleanup system
